# DATA ANALYSIS
- For the name column, consider only pulling the last name
- Associate the last name with the cabin
- The fare column may not be relevant as higher paying costumers still died while some lower paying costumers survived
- Try to link the last names with, sibSp, Parch, and cabin
- Embarked may not be useful
